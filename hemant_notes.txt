You have been made a collaborator to a github project:

https://github.com/UrbanSpectra/first-null-commit

You need to learn to push a "null commit" to that github repo.
You would clone that github repo to your system using git.
Add and edit a file.
Use git to add and commit.
Then push and submit github credentials.
And then you would see your commit as the most recent one on this github project repo url:
https://github.com/UrbanSpectra/first-null-commit

You will need to find gitbash prompt....
Described here...  https://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/install-git-bash
That shell supports bash and git statements on a command line.

Here is the recipe for first null commit:

1.  cd /path/to/web/root/
2.  git clone https://github.com/UrbanSpectra/first-null-commit
3.  cd first-null-commit
4.  touch null_commit_hemant.txt
5.  edit that file in editor:  use notepad++  ...  http://notepad-plus-plus.org/
6.  save that file with a single line and then return to gitbash prompt
7.  git add .
8.  git commit -m 'First null commit.'
9.  git push
